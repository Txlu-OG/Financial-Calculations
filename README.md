# Financial-Calculations
This repository contains Python scripts for common financial calculations that are useful in real-world finance. These calculations include loan amortization, weighted average cost of capital (WACC), internal rate of return (IRR), price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, and break-even analysis.

## Calculations Included:
### Loan Amortization (Monthly Payment Calculation)
Determines the fixed monthly payment for a loan based on principal, interest rate, and loan term.
### Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
Calculates the overall cost of capital for a business, considering equity and debt financing.
### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
Finds the rate of return for an investment that makes the net present value (NPV) of cash flows equal to zero.
### Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio
Calculates the valuation of a company based on its current stock price and earnings per share (EPS).
### Break-Even Analysis
Determines the number of units a business must sell to cover both fixed and variable costs.
